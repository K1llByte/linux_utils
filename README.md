# LinuxScripts

Respoitory dedicated to bash scripts, dotfiles and my personal standards / guidelines

## Plans

- [x] Auto Scripts Installer
- [ ] Firewall Network IP automate
- [x] Auto alias maker

### Firewall Network IP automate file syntax

`[port] [ip]`

```
6666 11.111.1.11
6666 34.141.22.51
```

> Also, other easier and more manaable way is to just have a file with the ips separed by a breakline
